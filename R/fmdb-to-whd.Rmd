The goal of this analysis is to link all WDNR fishery survey/monitoring sites to the 24k WHD. In other works, we need a crosswalk table between site.seq.no (SWIMS station ID) and hydroid/reach ids. This way data associated with the Hydro Geodatabase can be linked to fisheries data. 


## Get surevy data

```{r}

yrs <- list(1994:1998, 1999:2003, 2004:2008, 2009:2013, 2014:2018, 2019:2021)

waterbody_types <- c(
  "wadable_stream", 
  "non-wadable_stream", 
  "streams"
)


# Fetch data -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Survey data (42 seconds)
system.time(
  df_surveys_raw <- yrs %>%
    purrr::map_df(~get_fmdb_surveys(
      year = .,
      waterbody_type = waterbody_types
    ))
)

```
